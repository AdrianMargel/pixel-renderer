This is a simple ray tracter for creating lighting effects on 3d textures. It supports colored lighting, colored textures and shadows. It runs on the CPU and existing mostly as a proof of concept. It does run still run in real time but can easily become lagged out when trying to handle too many light sources.

The code was written summer 2017
